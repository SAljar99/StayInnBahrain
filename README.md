### **_Description_**

**StayInnBahrain** is a full-stack hotel flat booking system built with the MERN stack. It allows users to book flats across hotel branches in Manama and Muharraq, upload CPR card images for verification, and manage bookings easily.

This system solves problems like:

- Scattered flat availability across multiple branches
- Manual, non-centralized booking workflows
- Identity verification delays due to paperwork
- Lack of timely rent reminders
